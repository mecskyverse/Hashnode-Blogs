## The Enemy which I haven't met yet. Sharing My University Experience

#BlogsWithCC<br>
My experience starts when I was in high school and an average student. In the end, I got 82% on my boards and as a student of Maths, the hype was already there if you've cracked jee you have everything if not you have nothing. So, after following the herd mentality for some months, my mind was like "galat panga le Liya hai bro". I've failed jee and my drop year was wasted.  
 
Now, it's time to get a college when I discussed it with my father they told me that choose a College which is  Big and provides opportunities to you and after fulfilling one of the above criteria I got admission to** Chandigarh University**. Now due to my marks in jee, they gave me a scholarship of 40% with **two criteria to fulfil every semester** which is to get a GPA above 7.5 and the second one which I will tell you later on. My first semester was online so got some normal problems like assignments, 10 worksheets, 20 quizzes and loads of other formalities and whatnot. Just felt like I was lost somewhere but dealing with it and wasting my time over these formalities reminded me of that two criteria every day and pushed me to work like an OX. My first sem got completed and I fulfilled both the criteria so that my scholarship continued.

Now, the second semester started which was also online and I have decided to set my college work aside and focus more on what will benefit me. Then I explore the **YOUTUBE world **about the placements and colleges full of roadmap, advice, do this do that if you haven't done this you are going nowhere and one more time doing the same mistake following the** herd mentality of "MAANG!" "MAANG!" in the whole youtube** and started to do DSA doing CodeChef, code forces trying to do CP just juggling between the dsa courses and trying to do all the work at the same time. I have started so many things but didn't get it to the end just juggling from one roadmap to another. 

Then the time comes up for which I am truly grateful for, when I was listening to an Ishan Sharma podcast and just found [Kunal kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/c/KunalKushwaha) on that podcast. My whole bubble has been cracked down. This guy is telling FAANG is not the only path CP is not mandatory. Do open source do remote work and I was like, are these opportunities really exist if yes then why everybody is not talking about these opportunities? And I follow some of his advice and started learning in public proving my credibility, exploring some development fields everything was going great with his advice my college mates started to recognize me.


Now comes the worst part of my college life, second-semester exams got started and I was not that prepared but exams were also online so no worries. And the second criteria which I was talking about is that you should not get G, H or I grades in any subject exam. I have failed to fulfil that second criterion but how? In our second sem, we have a subject called Life Skills and Mentoring where your mentor who is also your subject teacher does some gossip about college and all that shit stuff we don't have any exams for this subject in our first sem so I thought being not fully present for this subject is okay. This is where my University played a bloody game and at the end of the second semester, they marked this subject as mandatory for exams. But I was not having 75% attendance in only this subject and the university has told the students that I grade is allotted to students who haven't got 75% attendance in any subject. This is where they removed my scholarship applied a 5000 rupees late fee no me and did whatever they can do to get money from the students and this is where **I believed my university is my biggest enemy**. 

This motivates me every time I procrastinate or waste my time that I have to beat that enemy, in the last 2-3 months I have progressed much more than I have done in my whole first year just imagining what my university has done to me fills up me with energy and I don't know what I am going to be but one thing is for sure I am not this much clear in my whole life. 3rd sem has not yet started but I am far more ahead of my peers. I have not visited my college once and I don't want to but I am thankful for this college which helped me to see who really I am.
