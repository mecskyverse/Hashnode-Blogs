## I want to build Decentralised Fundraising Platform.

### Overview

Hey, Guys as I am currently learning About Blockchain Development and Web3. One thing I know about it is that you cannot apply blockchain everywhere but there are places where we still use blockchain for a better purpose. Fundraising platforms or Donation platforms are one of them. 

## The Problem

Over the past some years there is a rise in the donation and fundraiser platforms some of them are operated are NGOs and Its good to donate towards a better world but when these types of platforms and their non-well-researched donation campaigns are found to be frauds then that's a critical issue. Some [reports](https://www.opindia.com/2022/08/fake-fundraisers-morphed-medical-documents-fundraising-scams-online-platforms-donations-ketto-milaap/) show that these fundraiser scams are worth crores.

## My Project
One of the potential solutions to this problem I found is in blockchain this Donation platform lacks in the **Transparency** but how can Blockchain provide transparency to understand this let's discuss some basics of the Blockchain.

Blockchain is a shared ledger of all the transactions that happened in the past it is encrypted by cryptography and every node or participant maintains this transaction history so if someone tries to hack into this system then they will have to change this transaction history into all the computers which are very hectic and next to impossible to do.

Based on this idea of the Ethereum blockchain my project can provide transparency to the donors. 

### Features
- Every donor would be able to see how much crypto has been donated to the NGO and how they are spending it on various occasions.
- In the case of Medical fundraisers the Authorised hospital can provide a private Key to the patient so that transaction would be legit.
- A multi Signature wallet refers that a smart contract that would be signed by some percentage of experts so that there will be no chance of fraud in these transactions.

## How can I achieve it
One of the key features of this project is decentralization and to make it more decentralised Ethereum Blockchain would be my preferred choice. 
### Solidity Smart Contract
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. These conditions can be like after enough signatures of experts these funds would be directly donated to the main party. NGOs can show every major and minor spending in form of cryptocurrency so that transparency can be settled.

### Hardhat 
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment. Compile your contracts and run them on a development network this development environment would be helpful to make a fully-fledged web application on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Conclusion 
With Blockchain or a centralised server, the target is to fill this big loophole in the system. Although these scams are small in comparison to the Big NGOs and Fundraisers which are truly working towards the betterment of the world but this can be enough to disbelieve in true NGOs and to solve this problem I wanted to build this project.
