VS code is by far one of the most famous code editors but for an untrained developer it might be a simple code editor like notepad or word but in reality, it has a tonne of productivity-boosting features. In this blog, I will share with you some of the best tools of VS code which can multiply your productivity.

## 1. GitHub Copilot
It uses the Open AI codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor. It works across dozens of languages and a cool feature about it is that you can use just comments of what you want to do and Copilot will give you the whole function for it.

Copilot can make your task easy and smooth and if you will use it for some time then definitely it will read your mind to suggest what you wanted to code. Most of the time you can access it free from GitHub or use student code to access its free version.

## 2. GitHub Copilot Labs

Have you faced a problem where you don't know the language much but coding in it and facing an issue understanding how the code is working? Well, I have faced this issue a lot till I don't know about the Copilot labs. Copilot labs convert your code into simple human-readable steps and help you to understand code.

## 3. VS Code Hot Keys 
VS Code is full of features for a developer and if we talk in comparison using only a keyboard and doing all the work is much faster than using a mouse. You can access all the features with key bindings which you can access with a mouse. 

- Key Bindings
Use
```
ctrl + k + ctrl + s
``` 
and you can change any keybindings according to you.

You don't need to learn all of them but using 10-15 is more than enough and this will increase your productivity.


- Show all commands

Most of the extensions in Vs code come with pre-defined commands and there is a hell 
 lot of commands in vs code itself you just need to type

```
ctrl + shift + p
``` 
and type any script you want.

- navigate file
Sometimes when you are working on a large scale project it gets cumbersome to navigate between files and open a particular file.
By using
```
ctrl + p
``` 
you can navigate between any folder or any file just type the name of the file and VS code will give you the suggestions for which file you want to open.

## 4. Music while coding
If you are one of them who loves to listen to music while coding or doing any other task. VS code got you covered for that also. With and an extension called vscode-spotify you can connect your spotify account to VS code and enjoy music.

It comes with some cool features like you can control over music directly with a code editor and also edit JSON file to listen according to you.

## 5. Live Share-
  Many of us have been worked in a team on a project and worked live on a project with teammates we have used git and git is a powerful tool but it has some problems like merge conflict and if two or more people working on the same file than it will become cumbersome to manage that file. Here to save us comes **VS code Live share Extension.**

## 7. Commonly Used Extension-
When I was a newbie and learning to code the biggest problem I was facing is the little problems like forgetting to close the HTML tag, semi-colons and brackets and by the time I found some extensions, it helped me a lot to write a clear piece of code.

- Prettier 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1662993104590/w8X26l2Pq.png align="center")

This extension can help you to format your code by just saving the code and it comes with a JSON file which you can edit to control the line space, formatting or indentation according to yo.

-Auto Close Tag 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1662993262038/9gZ-yBxa2.png align="center")

It helps you to auto-close the HTML tags and when you try to replace or rename an HTML opening tag then this will automatically change the closing tag with it.
