## 5 Practical Tips to learn different technologies at the same time.

While learning as a student most of the time you want to know different technologies as an interest but eventually, you end up learning none. In this article, I am going to share some practical tips which I am using currently as a student to learn different tech. 

### 1. Try not to learn totally different tech domains-
Many times we are interested in learning different tech domains and this can be good for you but the more different fields you will choose it will get more and more focus and energy-consuming process. I advise you to select tech domains which can be interrelated to each other for example Blockchain Development and Web Development or Computer networking with Cyber security these things are interrelated in some way or another which will eventually help you to spend less energy and shift to another technology very easily.

### 2. Do Parallel Tasking and divide your time into Slots-
You don't need to do multi-tasking to learn different techs. According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/health/only-2-of-people-can-actually-multitask160-160this-test-will-tell-you-if-you-are-one-of-them/articleshow/34849854.cms) only around 2% of the population is able to do multi-task which means most probably we are not in this slot. 

Multi-task refers to doing 2 or more intense focus tasks at the same time like studying and watching a show. While studying and listening to music is also a multi-task in that case, you don't need to pay much attention to one of them.

**So, what should we do??**


Try parallel tasking which means dividing your time into slots like the morning you can learn one thing and evening another while learning one tech just forget about the other. Which will help you to grasp concepts more easily and effectively.

### 3. Learning while Doing-
See, the best thing about learning tech is that you will get practical knowledge of that tech in some way or another. For example, while learning cloud computing you have AWS, Google cloud and Civo for help to do some practical experiments on it. Learning a tech theoretically is good but doing it practically will help you to learn easily and your concept will become more strong.
#### How can you learn practically-

- By contributing to open source

- While making projects
- Taking parts in Hackathons

- Or try to write a simple blog post explaining that tech

### 4. Be Consistent-
Most of the time it happens that we start a learning process but we won't be able to keep up with it. If we break our consistency then we can forget some things and we have to again start from zero. So, better be consistent in your learning this will help you to grab the concepts more easily and saves you a lot of time. This consistency can be anything if you learn daily it will be consistent if you learn twice or thrice a week that will be also consistent. Believe me, I tried it on myself when I was in my first year I have wasted so much time juggling from one tech to another and that costs me a year's waste without being able to learn in a true sense.

### 5. The end of learning tech is NOWHERE-
Some techs are so much wide that it can take you years to master them like Full stack development but you should know that mastering a tech should not be the ultimate goal because every time new features and new updates come up. So, better to avoid going into deep-dive learning while starting up because that will be of no use, few days without using that tech and you will forget most of the things. So, try to learn the things which are most useful in tech and make practical learning your habit so that other deep dive concepts you will eventually learn while doing.
