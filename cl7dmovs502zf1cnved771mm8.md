## 1. Do Experiments
Every time you run into a problem take it as a learning experience for yourself and try to debug with yourself. Do some print statements or try to explore what can go wrong this will make you confident with the problem but do not stick with these steps if you can't solve it by yourself take the next step.

just do a ctrl+f or search in the documentation and Bamn you can find the solution or either some extra knowledge.

## 3. Do a web search
Believe it or not but the best software Engineer is at the end of the day a good googler. They know how to google things up. These are some best practise while googling like you can search for important keywords within the double quotes to enhance your result.

One of the best ways I use is to paste the important line of the error to google and it can help me to get search results like StackOverflow.

## 4. Ask questions on forums & QnA sites
Now, this can sound silly but 
> There is nothing like a bad or poor question it can be a poorly formatted question. 

Everybody starts to learn at some point and your question can be as basic as "How to print a statement in python ?". So, the big question is how to format your questions.

There can be many ways but some of the best practices are to use code snippets try to be on the point don't put the whole code just give some background explain your error and search for some past questions like yours.

Attaching an article by StackOverflow to help you with it.

## 5. Join and Ask in communities-
The best way or you can call it my way after all the juggling from everywhere if you didn't find an answer to your problem then communities can be proven as a  goldmine not only do these communities help you to solve your problem but they can also help you to give tips to how to avoid this types of problem because somewhere someday someone has already faced the problem which you are facing currently.
